Overall, I struggled with this assignment. I was able to break down the steps that needed to happen on a piece of paper before starting to implement them. I could not clear the bigger image created from a click on the thumbnail.

Lowlights: I didn't managed the assignment well as I spent lots of time doing JavaScript and therefore didn't set up the accessibility and resolution properly. The main struggle I had was to clear the main image created. I knew I had to use functions such as clear() or remove() on the bigger image but didn't know where to put it on the code.

Heighlights: Being able to generate the thumbnail images and the "main image" was the thing I understood and executed well. Generating event, running loops through arrays are something the things I was able to utilise efficiently. I also managed to put in practice technical concepts that I learned last week (position absolute, create box, set up margin)
